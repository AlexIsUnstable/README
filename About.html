          Hi, I'm Alexander Humphrey, please call me Alex. My pronouns are he/him.

I was born in Chicago on November 23rd, 2005, I am currently a college freshman.
I'd say that usually being the youngest in my class growing up 
has affected me negatively and positively. I had a superiority
complex as well as a sort of inferiority complex, 
confusing right? I always wanted to be the best in
everything, I wanted to beat all my classmates in elementary 
and when I didn't (which was often) I'd loathe myself 
and beat myself up about it. Today though I've disposed 
of those mentalities. I don't want to be the best and I'm 
okay with that, I just want to be enough for myself. 
I'm very proud of my growth, not just with that but with 
so many other facets of myself. Today I feel as though 
I've never been more me.

I created Evergarden with aspiring artists in mind.
I see artists on TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter (X?)
who have masterpieces on hand and I wanted to create a centralized
location for people to discover these artists and their works of art. 
My end goal is a thriving online community of respected artists 
and loyal clientele; I want these artists to play a part in 
the design of the website as well. For example, a community 
voted artist spotlight where one artist is voted 
to be front and center on the homepage.
