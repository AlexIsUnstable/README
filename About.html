          Hi, I'm Alexander Humphrey, please call me Alex. My pronouns are he/him. <br/>

I was born in Chicago on November 23rd, 2005, I am currently a college freshman. <br/>
I'd say that usually being the youngest in my class growing up <br/>
has affected me negatively and positively. I had a superiority <br/>
complex as well as a sort of inferiority complex, <br/>
confusing right? I always wanted to be the best in <br/>
everything, I wanted to beat all my classmates in elementary <br/>
and when I didn't (which was often) I'd loathe myself <br/>
and beat myself up about it. Today though I've disposed <br/>
of those mentalities. I don't want to be the best and I'm <br/>
okay with that, I just want to be enough for myself. <br/>
I'm very proud of my growth, not just with that but with <br/>
so many other facets of myself. Today I feel as though <br/>
I've never been more me.

I created Evergarden with aspiring artists in mind. <br/>
I see artists on TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter (X?) <br/>
who have masterpieces on hand and I wanted to create a centralized<br/>
location for people to discover these artists and their works of art. <br/>
My end goal is a thriving online community of respected artists <br/>
and loyal clientele; I want these artists to play a part in <br/>
the design of the website as well. For example, a community <br/>
voted artist spotlight where one artist is voted <br/>
to be front and center on the homepage.
