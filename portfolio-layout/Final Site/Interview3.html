          <p>In the aftermath of a family celebration turned tragic, I had the opportunity to speak with Thomas, my father who experienced the unthinkable—being assaulted by his own son during his daughter's prom night. This incident, a stark manifestation of the complex interplay between mental health and violence, left deep emotional scars. </p>
          <p>Thomas, a man of quiet strength, recounted the night with a heavy heart. "It was supposed to be a night to celebrate my daughter," he began, his voice steady but tinged with sadness. "Instead, it became a night that destroyed our family." “He tried to kill me.” The violent act, fueled by his son's struggle with alcoholism and mental health issues, was a shock to all, leaving Thomas not only with physical wounds but also with a profound sense of betrayal and confusion.   </p>
          <p>The impact on Thomas's mental health was significant. "In the weeks that followed, I grappled with a range of emotions—anger, sorrow, disbelief. Sleep evaded me, and anxiety became a constant companion," he shared. The journey towards healing was not easy. It involved therapy, support from friends and family, and a personal commitment to understanding the underlying issues that led to the assault. </p>
          <p>Thomas's perspective on mental health has since evolved. "I've come to realize that mental illness can be a silent battle, and it often requires more compassion than condemnation," he reflected. His approach to forgiveness has been transformative, not only for his own mental health but also for the healing of his family. </p>
