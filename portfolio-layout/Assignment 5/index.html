    <p id="content">Back in highschool I made a vector art image taking inspiration from a poster for the "Shin Godzilla" movie. I wanted to capture the feeling of that poster so I painstakingly traced every line, crevice, and tooth of Godzilla. I also added some burning city buildings at the bottom to showcase the destructive force that godzilla is. I put a lot of time and effort into this project. I was and still am thoroughly satisfied with the final product. </p>
