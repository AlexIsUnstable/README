  <h2>Children Of The Sea</h2>
  <p>I love the visuals in this movie, the story is convoluted and a little nonsensical though. The music is also great. </p>
      <li><a href="https://aniwave.to/watch/children-of-the-sea.4ono/ep-1">Children of the sea</a>: The focal point of Ruka Azumi's unremarkable summertime break involves her devoting every moment to handball practice, as she strives to avoid encountering her sole housemate, her alcoholic mother. Regrettably, Ruka is disqualified from the handball squad following a mishap during a training session, which prompts her to search for new sources of amusement. This leads her to the aquarium where her father is employed, where she crosses paths with Umi, a puzzling young man who was nurtured by dugongs and is presently being studied at the aquarium owing to his bizarre water-reliant physique.
Ruka and Umi immediately click and develop a strong bond, with Sora, Umi's brother, who shares his sibling's unique relationship with the ocean, subsequently joining them. Together, the trio embarks on a mesmerizing aquatic adventure while simultaneously discovering a unique "festival" that is being prepared for by marine creatures worldwide.

  <h2>Redline</h2>
  <p>Action packed animation with a midly interesting story with excellent worldbuilding and music.</p>

  <h2>Weathering With You</h2>
  <p>The animation always blows me away. The sweeping shots and music as well. Also I love a romance story, and the desperation between these two lovers always captivtes my interest.</p>
          <li><a href="https://aniwave.to/watch/weathering-with-you.9xqn">Weathering With You</a>: The constant rain in Tokyo is disrupting the daily lives of its inhabitants. Hodaka Morishima, a struggling high school student, finds himself working at a small publishing company to make ends meet. Meanwhile, Hina Amano is also searching for a job to provide for herself and her younger brother.
Their fates become entwined when Hodaka tries to rescue Hina from some shady characters and they end up running away together. Hodaka soon discovers that Hina possesses an incredible power - she can summon the sun when she prays for it. Knowing the potential of her ability amidst Tokyo's unusual weather, Hodaka suggests that Hina become a "sunshine girl" to help clear the sky for those in need.
Initially, things begin to look up for the pair, but it soon becomes clear that every power comes with a price.

<section id="section4">
  <h2>Suzume</h2>
  <p>Another love story by the same studio that made weathering with you. They somehow manage to expand on their previous masterpieces.</p>
        <li><a href="https://aniwave.to/watch/suzume-no-tojimari.xrr5w">Suzume</a>: A 17-year-old girl named Suzume resides in a peaceful municipality in Kyushu. She sets forth on a voyage and coincidentally meets a young man who seeks an entrance. Collaboratively, they uncover a dilapidated gateway situated in the mountains, and Suzume unlocks it. This initiates the activation of other portals throughout Japan, releasing calamities of an enigmatic realm. As Suzume begins to grasp the state of affairs, she transforms and releases herself from previous limitations. Her goal is to shut the gates that cause havoc, eventually resulting in her own enlightenment.</li>

<section id="section5">
  <h2>Howl's Moving Castle</h2>
  <p>A classic.</p>
        <li><a href="https://aniwave.to/watch/howls-moving-castle.ll26">Howl's Moving Castle</a>: Sophie, a reserved worker in a hat store, experiences an upheaval in her life when a good-looking yet enigmatic wizard named Howl carries her away. Their camaraderie awakens the envy and spite of the egotistical Witch of the Waste, who retaliates by casting a curse on Sophie. Accompanied by Howl, Sophie embarks on a life-altering journey, boarding his astonishing airborne castle and venturing into a fantastical realm, determined to undo the hex.
